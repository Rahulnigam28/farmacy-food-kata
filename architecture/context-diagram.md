# Context Diagram 
The goal of this context diagram is to show the **scope** of the designed software system (shown in the middle) and indicate what
**external entities** the system interacts with. 

In the architecture views we find a description of the 
external entities in the diagram, along with an explanation of their interaction with the system.
